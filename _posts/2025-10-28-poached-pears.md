Requires very little work, makes your kitchen smell great, tastes delicious, and you may even have a few vitamins left in there (not 100% sure about that, would need to double check). Convincing intro: done.

First, let's make the syrup: 1L of water, 200g of sugar, and a splash of cider vinegar (for preservation I guess?). Let it boil for 5 minutes (to make the kitchen gods happy I guess?).

And now, let's start another task concurrently: `asyncio.create_task(peel_and_cut_pears)`. Sorry, bad geek joke, I won't do it again I promise.

So, let's peel the pears, cut them in half and remove the non-edible bits.
Some people prefer to just do the peeling and keep the whole pears intact.
I think that's stupid: yes the "whole pear" thing is very instagram-friendly, but you leave the painful burden of removing the non-edible bits **to your guests**, and they will have to do it **while they're eating** so you're basically ruining their moment.

Put the pears in the syrup and let them simmer for 10-15 minutes, depending on ripeness.

Turn the heat off and let the whole thing cool down.
It might take a few hours, but that's okay because you've anticipated this step and absolutely did not prepare these pears at the last minute.

Right before serving, melt some chocolate and pour it on top.
