Remember when you were a kid and the teacher would ask you what you wanted to become later?
I think it's a good practice to continue asking yourself this question regularly (maybe not everyday though, or you'll get bitten by the FOMO-squito).

Recently I found myself answering this: *I want to become a DJ*.
I just love to unearth artists and albums, old and new, famous and not, and then force the people around me to listen to it.
Sometimes they even like it and add it to their personal playlist, and to me that is pure bliss.

And now, I have a blog! Good people of the internet, here comes my 2025 list.
I hate long unfiltered lists, so I'll only put my top picks in there.

#### Filmmaker

an electronic music genius coming from Colombia, producing an impressive amount of about 4 albums each year, with a very unique dark dystopian techno style

---

#### Angsty Camboyz Revenge

a french-belgian duo, whose hyperpop-rap style is slitghly difficult to access at the very beginning, but patience is rewarded with one of the most addictive audio experience I've ever had

---

#### Iglooghost

[his website](https://iglooghost.net/) is probably a better reference than mine to understand his fascinating little universe

---

#### P.M. Dawn

I discovered their existence with the song *Set Adrift On Memory Bliss* in a record shop, and now I just can't get enough

---

#### Kangding Ray

the man behind the incredible soundtrack of the movie Sirat

There you go people, I hope you find something you like in there.
